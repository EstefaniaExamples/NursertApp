  // There's no point in separating the object and the command into variable
  //  and call... just do it on the one line - particularly with JS you see a
  //  lot of *very* large calls with a great many nested objects, arguably
  //  untidy but I much prefer it to seeing a call with ten variables in it
  //  which I then need to go and find elsewhere...
  // This comment was originally for this block:
  //       const data = await ddbClient.send(new QueryCommand({
  //         KeyConditionExpression: 'KidId=:n',
  //         ExpressionAttributeValues: {
  //           ':n': { N: '0' },
  //         },
  //         TableName: 'children-api-dev',
  //       }));
  //  but works here too
  const data = await ddbClient.send(new ScanCommand({
    TableName: 'children-api-dev'
  }));

  // Instead of creating a mutable array (`[]`), iterating another array
  //  (`.forEach`), and updating the first on each iteration of the second, it's
  //  simpler and neater to employ a functional programming idea (loosley) of
  //  mapping data. This way the result is the final array which can now be
  //  const
  //
  // Using string interpolation rather than `'Mykey: ' + myKey + ', myValue: ' +
  //  myValue` for a couple of reasons, the most important for me is
  //  JavaScript's handling of the + operator... e.g. 
  //      var a = 10;
  //      var b = 20;
  //      console.log('result is ' + a + b);
  //               => 'result is 1020'
  // They're also more flexible, multi-line strings are supported by default,
  //  you can embed expressions (e.g. `${1 + 2}`), etc.
  //
  // You can also use the optional chaining operator to avoid that `if (x ==
  //  undefined)` block, this way the rest of the chain is only ran if
  //  `data.Items` is not nullish
  //
  // It's also quite rare to see the `function() {}` syntax these days, the only
  //  benefit is preservation of the `this` keyword... but as `this` doesn't
  //  mean much of value here, an arrow function (`() => {}`) is more common
  //
  // Finally `String` is the Javascript type, not literal strings, nor
  //  Typescript strings, the type annotation you're after is `string` (that is
  //  unless you have a reason I missed)
  const kidsList: string[] = data.Items?.map(
    element => `${element.KidName.S} ${element.KidSurname.S} (${element.BirthDate.S})`
  ) || [];

  return simpleHttpResponse({ children: kidsList })
};

// In the context of a Lambda it's kinda difficult not to wrap the whole thing
//  in a try-catch as you need to control the response to the user in any
//  error scenario and this is an easy way to do this
// However, putting all the logic on an extra indentation inside the try-block
//  and retaining all the error logic makes the function a bit cumbersome - I
//  suppose it's a style choice but I would argue this is more readable
//
// Also the wrapped function returns a promise which means you can catch any
//  error through function chaining, no need for the try-catch at all
//
// Also, now the logic is moved out of this wrapper, the only statement is the
//  return, so we can clean this up even further removing some of those pesky
//  braces :D
const wrapper = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> =>
  get(event).catch((err: any) => simpleHttpResponse({ message: err.message }, 500));

// I'm guessing at some point you'll be registering and using more middleware,
//  as, at the mo, there's not much need for middy
export const handler = middy(wrapper);
